Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC) standards are designed in a modular way, where newer standards often extend or depend on foundational ones to ensure interoperability. For example, ERC-165 defines a standard interface detection mechanism that allows contracts to declare which functions they implement. This enables other contracts or applications to safely interact with them. Building on this, ERC-721 (non-fungible tokens) and ERC-1155 (multi-token standards) explicitly require ERC-165 to advertise their supported interfaces, ensuring consistent behavior across the ecosystem. Without these base dependencies, contracts may appear compatible but fail during runtime interactions, leading to interoperability and security issues.
